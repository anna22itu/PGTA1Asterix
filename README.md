**PGTA ASTERIX DECODER PROJECT**

First Part: Codification

Second Part: Simulator

The simulator contains a bar lateral main menu with which all the possible functions will be carried out, with its different buttons.

First, we must load the data with which we will work. By clicking on the ‘Load File’ button, a tab will open in which we will have to locally select our file to read, as can be seen in the following figure:

Once the file with all the data has been loaded, we have different options; export the file, view the data, and load the map.

1. If we export the file, an excel file will be created in our Interface>bin>Debug>net6.0-windows folder, where all the data read from the loaded file will be shown in table form.

2. Furthermore, if we want to display the data, we must click on the DataView button, which will open a new form with all the data:

Also, due to a large amount of data, there is the possibility of filtering. We have two different ways.

First, show the most relevant data or show all of them, through the checkboxes on the left.
Second, by selecting a feature, for example, Track Number, and clicking on the magnifying glass, a drop-down will open where you can enter the value of the track Number. As a result, we will get all the rows with a Track Number value equal to the one entered. We see an example in the following figure.

In addition, we have a button to know a little more about us, to know who we are, and the reason for this project.
